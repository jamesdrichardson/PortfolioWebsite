                <p>
                    My interests include writing, software development, philosophy, and music.
                     Previously I worked as a Senior IT Support Engineer at AlphaSights and 
                     currently I work at Netflix as an IT Support Specialist. I am now looking 
                     to break into the Software Development field, which has always been one of 
                     my passions. I am a hard worker, as well as a team player. I am also inquisitive
                      and will continue to work my hardest until the task in front of me is completed.
